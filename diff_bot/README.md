You will find a lot of files in here. What you will also see in this repository is a folder called "sensors" and "worlds".

I have purposefully not added this in the gazebo.launch file yet. If you want to, you can try learning how to launch a world file through ".launch" files. If you don't want to, I will add everything in a few days.
