### Hello! So, you decided to open the folder and actually see whats going on? Good for you and thank you for showing interest!

You will find a lot of files in here. What you will also see in this repository is a folder called "sensors" and "worlds".

I have purposefully not added most of the sensors and kept the world empty in the gazebo.launch file. 
If you want to launch a world (ie, add a world to the simulation), you have to run -
```
roslaunch diff_bot all.launch
```

I know what you are thinking, "This launched the world file, what to do if I want to put in sensor files?"

Wait a little. First understand the launch file for gazebo.launch and all.launch. By that time, I will add sensor files in all.launch. 

Thank you for your patience and happy learning!
